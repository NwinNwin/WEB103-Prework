## Notes

When I began developing my web application, grappling with Supabase was a significant hurdle, given it was my first experience with the tool. The initial phases were filled with uncertainties and steep learning curves. However, with consistent effort, engaging with the community, and immersing myself in documentation, I gradually overcame the challenges. Today, not only am I proficient with Supabase, but this journey has also bolstered my confidence in navigating new technologies, reinforcing that with determination and the right resources, mastering new tools is always achievable.
